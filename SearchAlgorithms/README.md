IN ORBIT ASSEMBLY OF LARGE STRUCTURES

This program aims to solve the problem of scheduling the launch of components for the in orbit assembly of a large structure. Given a set of components to be launched, a launch timeline and costs, and a construction plan, the goal is to determine the assignment of components to launches, such as the total cost is minimized.
